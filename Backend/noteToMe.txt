setting up the database schema
first type npm install prisma inside the terminal
this will create a folder with the schema.prisma file inside 
that is where the models for the database will be there
and believe me if you want a sane mind you need to remove the output part from the generator part of schema.prisma 
to make sure the generator is actually ES6 compatible
then in your .env file set the DATA_BASE_URL to some data base you created
first install postgres and create a database 

to create the database first go to this path in cmd:
C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\18\bin the 18 part could be different based on the time you install it.
so cd C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\18\bin
then write psql -U postgres(this is your username)
then it will ask you for password: type your password and then your are logged in.
now you can create your database.
psql -U postgres
# enter password
\l                      # list all databases
\c my_database          # connect to "my_database"
\dt                     # list all tables
SELECT * FROM users;    # see contents
\q                      # quit


Then in your .env file make sure the DATA_BASE_URL is structured in the following way
postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/yourDataBaseName and make sure to insert the password you used for postgres set up


// then first write npm init -y in the terminal to create node_modules and package.json to keep versions of dependencies you install
write npm install to get everything from package.json

after this run npx prisma generate this creates a client you can use in your Node/Express app.
then npx prisma migrate dev --name init if this is not saying Your database is now in sync with your schema
or opening prisma.js change the name of prisma.js to prismaClient.js it's not opening because of nameing confilict
npx prisma studio
