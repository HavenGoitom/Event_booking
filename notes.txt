setting up the database schema
first type npm install prisma inside the terminal
this will create a folder with the schema.prisma file inside 
that is where the models for the database will be there
and believe me if you want a sane mind you need to remove the output part from the generator part of schema.prisma 
to make sure the generator is actually ES6 compatible
then in your .env file set the DATA_BASE_URL to some data base you created
first install postgres and create a database 
Then in your .env file make sure the DATA_BASE_URL is structured in the following way
postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/yourDataBaseName and make sure to insert the password you used for postgres set up

// then first write npm init -y in the terminal to create node_modules and package.json to keep versions of dependencies you install
write npm install to get everything from package.json
// npm init -y 
// npm install prisma
// npm install @prisma/client
// npx prisma init -> initializes prisma/ folder with schema.prisma
